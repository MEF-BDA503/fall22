    "text": "What is reproducibility?\nIn simple terms, the ability to reproduce result and analysis without much effort.\nA fully reproducible analysis should include raw data and clear methodology (also, if possible, code) behind the analysis.\nThere are consequences if a study is not reproducible. Read more about reproducibility crisis here.\nSee a webinar here about how to create reproducible reports with R Markdown. We will learn basics of R Markdown as soon as possible and do similar stuff.\nAdditionally, if you can generalize your templates, you can reproduce the study for different data sets in the same topic. It can be financial reports for companies, weather reports for cities etc. See an example here about elections (in Turkish) where each city and county’s reports are generated using a single template."

You can start learning from here.\n\n\nImportant Update - Quarto (2022)\n\nIn July 2022, RStudio announced that they will change their name to Posit starting from November 2022. They are going to be more inclusive towards Python.\nThey announced Python Shiny (still in Alpha phase).\nThey also announced Quarto will supersede RMarkdown. Announcement came a little late, so there are no lecture notes about Quarto. However, a list of sources and quality guides will be included in a separate document.\nUltimately these updates are to your benefit. You will be able to integrate Python and R as seamlessly as possible. Also, some of what you learned in this class will be applicable to Python."
